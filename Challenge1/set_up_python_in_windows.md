To use Python in our computers we need to install the Python Interpreter.

***Python***

Go here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and 
click on the yellow button "Download Python 3.7.3"

After download open/execute the installer. 
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!!!

!!!IMPORTANT!!! After opening/executing the installer,
at the bottom of the python installer window,
there is a check box that says: "Add Python 3.7 to PATH" MAKE SURE YOU CHECK IT!
This is a VERY IMPORTANT step.

After clicking on "Add Python 3.7 to PATH" click on
first option "Install Now", the installation process will begin.
This should take a couple of minutes at most.

After the message "Setup was successful" simply click close.

***Visual Studio Code***

We can use any text editor to create Python programs, but a code editor like
Visual Studio Code is better suited for this task and it is what we will use for coding:
Go here: https://code.visualstudio.com/ and
click on the green button "Download for Windows - Stable build"

Follow the instructions on the setup window, you can leave the default options
since those are good.

***Git***

In order to use the code you are seeing we need to install Git on your computer.

Git is a 'Version Control System' or VCS that provides a developer with tools to 
have different versions of the code they write and save them on a site like GitHub.

To use this code you will need to install a Git client in your computer.
Please head to the following link and download the installer.
This installer will only work for Windows machines.

https://git-scm.com/download/win

Once it is downloaded please install.

Press the Next button until asked about the default editor. The title will read 'Choosing the default editor used by Git', in the drop-down menu you will choose Visual Studio Code, since we already installed it on our machine. Click next.

The title should change to 'Adjusting your PATH environment' here select the option: 'Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software'. Click next.

Then the title should change to 'Choosing HTTPS transport backend', please select: 'Use the OpenSSL library'. Click next.

The title should change to 'Configuring the line ending conversiosn' please select 'Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings'. Click next.

In the title 'Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash' please select: 'Use Windows' default console window'. Click next.

Leave defaults from now on and just keep clicking next until the install option appears; then install.


Please restart your computer after installing the programs.
